WebXR is a subset of APIs that requires a certain type of hardware and its capabilities, such as camera sensors, gyroscope, accelerometer, computation power, CV techniques, as well as software support.

While the market is constantly evolving and platform vendors improving their software, we try to ensure that PlayCanvas WebXR support is up to date and supports the widest range of platforms.
